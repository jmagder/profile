<h2>Software Engineer (B.Sc.) with 15+ years professional experience</h2>
<p>
    Hi, I'm Jeffrey Magder. I've worked on projects all over the map from embedded low level driver development in C, to
    enterprise Java
    based software, to highly interactive Web 2.0 Single Page Apps (SPA) using JavaScript, Node.js and
    associated technologies. My broad experience has given me insight and appreciation to common patterns across the
    development spectrum in many languages. It continues to show me that theories of computation, algorithms, data
    structures, and general computer science are applicable across all domains vertical and horizontal.
</p>

<p>
    Colleagues describe me as an energetic, positive thinker and problem solver who works very well with others. I live
    and breathe technology, and find few things as exciting as furthering its development. My work ethic is strong with
    a proven dedication to product quality and cross-team efficiency. Where possible, I consistently strive for the
    right fix which is not necessarily the ‘quick’ fix. Instead of just fixing the bug at hand, I like to take it many
    steps further by looking for other areas of code that may have the same problems.
</p>

<p>
    It's an exciting time to be in the field, with such rapidly changing landscapes. I'm always interested in hearing
    from like minded companies and individuals who are also interested in moving forward the state of the art as both
    contract and full time opportunities.
